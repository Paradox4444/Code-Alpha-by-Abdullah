Basic Network Sniffer

Build a network sniffer in Python that captures and analyzes network traffic. This project will help you understand how data flows on a network and how network packets are structured.
A network sniffer is a tool used in cyber security to monitor and capture data packets traveling across a network. It listens to all the traffic on the network interface and records the data being transmitted. Network sniffers are useful for:

Analyzing network performance: Detecting traffic patterns and bottlenecks.
Identifying security issues: Monitoring unauthorized access or detecting malicious activity.
Troubleshooting network problems: Diagnosing connection issues.
Capturing data for forensic purposes: Collecting evidence in case of a cyber incident.
How the Code Works (Using Scapy)
Scapy is a powerful Python library that helps in packet manipulation and network scanning. A basic network sniffer works by capturing packets and displaying their details.

Here's a simplified explanation of how your code might work:

Importing Libraries:


from scapy.all import *
Defining the Sniffer Function: The code typically uses the sniff() function from Scapy, which captures packets.


def packet_sniffer(packet):
    print(packet.show())  # Displays the packet's details
Running the Sniffer: The sniff() function is called to listen for packets on a specific network interface.


sniff(prn=packet_sniffer, count=10)  # Sniffs 10 packets and calls packet_sniffer on each
prn=packet_sniffer: Processes each packet with the packet_sniffer() function.
count=10: Specifies the number of packets to capture (you can modify this for continuous capture).
This is a basic example, but it shows how your network sniffer captures network traffic, displays packet details, and helps with analysis.
